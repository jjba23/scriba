    (description
     "Scriba is a structured logging library for GNU Guile that prioritizes
flexibility and observability.  It provides modular log routing, formatting,
and filtering, allowing developers to generate human-readable console logs
during development, machine-readable JSON logs for production environments,
and rotating plaintext logs on disk.
Key features include an auto-logger configured via environment variables,
dynamically scoped log contexts using Scheme parameters, ahead-of-time log
level filtering, and minimal runtime overhead achieved through memoization
and compile-time macros.")
